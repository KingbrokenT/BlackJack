# BlackJack
# These files are just part of a "milestone project" I did as part of learning more python through a udemy course (2021 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in #Python by Jose Portilla). Feel free to give it a try if you want :)
# The files are just Jupyter notebooks. The last cell is the game and the cells before that set up classes and/or functions
# I first made the "blackjack - milestone2 file so I could try to make the game myself. It does some basic things, but it is a bit messy. Then I worked through the #walkthrough so I could get a sense of how the course instructures imagined me going through the project. Their suggestions make the code simpler, but some of the #functions were a bit weird to work with.
